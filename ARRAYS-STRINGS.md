(1) Write a program that sets up a **String variable** containing a **paragraph of text** of your choice. **Extract the
words** from the text and **sort** them into alphabetical order. **Display** the sorted **list of words**. You could use a
simple sorting method called the **bubble sort**. To sort an array into ascending order the process is as follows:
	a.Starting with the ﬁ rst element in the array, compare successive elements (0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and
	3, and so on).
	b.If the ﬁrst element of any pair is greater than the second, interchange the two elements.
	c.Repeat the process for the whole array until no interchanges are necessary. The array elements
	are now in ascending order.
	
(2) Deﬁne an **array** of **ten String elements** each containing an arbitrary string of the form **“month/day/
year”**; for example, **”10/29/99”** or **“12/5/01”** . Analyze each element in the array and output the date
represented in the form **29th October 1999**.

(3) Write a program that **reverses the sequence of letters** in each **word** **of** your **chosen paragraph**.
For instance, **“To be or not to be.”** becomes **“oT eb ro ton ot eb.”**
