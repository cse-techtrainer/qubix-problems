1. Create a program to calculate the grade of a studnet for the given marks. The grade is calculated as under 90 (inclusive) - 100 gets grade 'A', 80 (inclusive) but less than 90 will get a grade of 'B', 70 (inclusive) - but less than 80 will get a grade of 'C', 60 (inclusive) - but less than 80 will get a grade of 'D', otherwise student will get a grade 'F' 

2. Write a program to find a substring in the given string.

3. Create an infinite loop by using for and while loop.

4. ( Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent
an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables—a part number (type String ), a part description (type String ), a quantity of the item being purchased (type int ) and a price per item ( double ). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0 . If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0 . Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice ’s capabilities.

5. (Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that
your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the Amer-ican Heart Association (AHA) ( www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736 ), theformula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health-care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.] Create a class called HeartRates . The class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide set and get methods. The class also should include a method that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and returns the person’s maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate. Write a Java app that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name and date of birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.
