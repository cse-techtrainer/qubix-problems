# Problems Based on Basic Concepts of Java


(1). Write a console program to declare and initialize a double variable with some value such as **1234.5678**.
Retrieve the **integral** part of the value and store it in a variable of type **long** , and retrieve the **ﬁrst four digits
of the fractional part** and **store** them in an integer of type **short** . Display the value of the double variable
by outputting the two values stored as integers.

(2) A **lottery** requires that you select **six different numbers** from the integers **1 to 49**. Write a program to do this
for you and generate **ﬁve sets** of entries.

(3) Write a program to generate a **random sequence of capital letters** that does **not include vowels**.
